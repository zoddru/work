Data can be exported and shared across the council, but mostly it requires manual integration and there are few consistent data standards used across the whole organisation.   Most data that is exported from IT systems is of useable standard but errors remain and are not addressed comprehensively.  Meta-data can sometimes be used to identify data quality issues but mainly it is the responsibility of staff involved in line of business data collection.</p></div>;
