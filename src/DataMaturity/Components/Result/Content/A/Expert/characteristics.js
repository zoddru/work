Data can be accessed in a timely manner to provide a holistic view, but data is not collected where the immediate use is not apparent (avoiding data exhaust).  A data warehouse or federated data models are used so that data is owned diffusely but can be integrated easily/automatically. Data architecture is fully developed with consistent data standards. There is an information asset list or inventory which is published as metadata and is used to enable quality management. Unique identifiers such as UPRN or personal identifiers are employed where relevant to enable the integration of data across multiple line of business systems.  All data is of useable quality and data quality issues are well understood and managed by all staff proactively.</p></div>;
