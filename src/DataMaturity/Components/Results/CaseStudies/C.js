        Manchester's data warehouse has embedded decision-making about data sharing between agencies. This is based on expert legal guidance and the system is built to reframe the idea of sharing information. Through the new system, key workers do not have to ask to share data, they are entitled to see data in line with the responsibilities and duties of their job. The decisions built into the system were based on meticulous work to decide the legality of sharing data in very specific, defined instances. This includes sharing school attendance information, or reports of police call-outs, where there is a safeguarding concern about the child. Advice from a barrister was sought on these specific instances, which then informed the development of a Privacy Impact Assessment in collaboration with partner agencies. Manchester wanted to reduce individual decision-making about data sharing because different interpretations led to inconsistencies in which data was being shared.

        The data warehouse presents a system which protects data better than a manual process, while also permitting data sharing in instances where the legislation allows it. The system records the digital footprints of system users which means that any inappropriate use can be detected and acted upon. Having these data sharing agreements in place also means that data can be anonymised and analysed at a population level.
