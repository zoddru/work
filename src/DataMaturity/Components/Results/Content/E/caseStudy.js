    <p><strong>Newcastle's Family Insights Programme</strong></p>
    <p>
        Newcastle shifted its internal culture and awareness of data through the data-informed redesign of children's social care services. The Family Insights Programme (FIP) embeds data analysts in some children's social work teams. Their role is to look for hypotheses to test, analysis to perform and other ways of supporting the work of the social workers using data. Data analysts take part in team meetings, attend supervisions and are constantly listening to the experiences of the social workers and families. Their role is not purely quantitative and they are expected to identify themes and undertake deep-dive analysis or case study analysis. The data analysts also test what works, measuring the success of externally commissioned services, along with cost information.

        Social workers have reported being consistently happier with the working environment and have lower levels of absence. The dashboards created by the analysts reduce the amount of management time tied up in compliance which means supervision with managers can be more oriented on improving practice. The Family Insight Programme has increased social work time working directly with families, from 27 per cent pre-FIP towards the target of 50 per cent. Early indications are that the data-led social work teams are closing cases quicker and have fewer re-referrals than non-data led teams.

        Across the organisation the mindset about data has changed. Social workers now see data in a more positive way and believe it can be used to help them perform their jobs better.  In the words of one social work manager “It's opened up decision-making to the use of data and analysis. That's the difference in the organisation between where we were and where we are now”. There has been an impact at senior leadership level too, where there is a strong expectation that decisions will be informed by data analysis.
