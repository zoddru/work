    <p><strong>Essexâ€™s Data Analytics Hub</strong></p>
    <p>
        Essex has developed a data analytics hub through which it has grown its own in-house capacity. The data analysts are responsible for bringing together data from different parts of the council, integrating and using for a range of data-informed projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The covers a wide range of data skills, from management through to analytical techniques. One example is the use of predictive algorithms, which which help the council to identify potential adverse events before they happen. For instance, the council has recently undertaken work to predict which areas are most likely to have children which are not school ready at age 4. This enables them to intervene early with additional support for children in those areas. Alongside the sophisticated technical skills of the team, the staff who use the insights produced by the hub are required to have a high level of data literacy to enable them to use them in decision making.
