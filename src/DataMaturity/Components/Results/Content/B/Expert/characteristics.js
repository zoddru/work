Data is used to support service delivery in real-time, is used to understand in granular detail issues of performance, and can be used to understand the effectiveness of services and individual interventions. Relevant data is collected to monitor outcomes and historic data sets that are no longer relevant are retired. Data is used in real time where possible, often with APIs. Processes which require little to no human judgement have been automated and optimised using data.</p></div>;
