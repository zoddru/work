There is no senior officer responsible for data, and any sharing is ad-hoc and there few if any organisational policies designed to support legal sharing of data. There are few if any resources to help staff make consistent decisions about data sharing.  It is difficult to draw an organisational view of a service, issue or individual using data because of concerns about data sharing.</p></div>;
