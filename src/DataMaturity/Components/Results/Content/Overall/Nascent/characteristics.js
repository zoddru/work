Some council data is not available due  to outsourced service contracts. Data quality is likely to be poor and the issue poorly understood in the organisation.</li><li>There is no emphasis on the benefits of legal data sharing, and data protection legislation is seen as a reason not to share data.</li><li>Few if any services use data as a means of improvement. Making important decisions without considering data analysis of its possible implications is seen as acceptable.</li><li>Only the most basic of data analytic capability exists, and is patchy across the organisation. The level of analytical insight available is limited to very basic KPI or performance management metrics.</li><li>Data is not viewed as an organisational asset, its value is not fully understood at any level of the organisation. Senior officers have not championed data use or its inclusion in strategies and policies.</li></ul></div>;
