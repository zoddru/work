There is no formal data management capability and data is collected,  stored, and processed in ad-hoc ways, usually dictated by operational processes. Meta-data is not used to audit the quality of data. The ability to bring together data from different parts of the organisation is limited and significant resources would have to be deployed to make any outputs of such an exercise useable.</p></div>;
