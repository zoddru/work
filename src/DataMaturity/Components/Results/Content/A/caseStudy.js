        <strong>LB Barking and Dagenham Residentâ€™s Matrix</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Resident's Matrix" (RM) is a combination of multiple datasets from across both council and non-council data sources to develop both a single view of the resident as well as the single view of the household. Combining both internal and external data sources (e.g. NHS GP register data) allows the borough to create the fullest picture possible of the total borough population, since not everyone living in the borough is necessarily registered on its systems.

        The RM was developed in-house and at fraction of the cost of an off-the-shelf software solution, while providing higher degrees of accuracy. Using the RM, the council is able to, for example, categorise households into type, e.g. single person, single parent, older person living alone, family household, three generational household, etc. - a task that would have been impossible using council data only. With the borough undergoing big demographic shifts, this level of detail and the ability to track and predict change is vital.
