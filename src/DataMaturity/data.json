His wristwatch chimed against the water glass on the nightstand. Then he and a gust of chilly air got in under the covers, bearing with them an odor of cigarette, armpit, damp wool, and something sweet and somehow nostalgic that Sammy presently identified as the smell, on his cousin's breath, of prunes from the leftover ingot of his mother's \"special\" meatloaf--prunes were only a small part of what made it so very special--which he had seen her wrap like a parcel in a sheet of wax paper and set on a plate in the Frigidaire.
